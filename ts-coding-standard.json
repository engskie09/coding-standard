        "Declaration-style dynamic imports (e.g., `const foo = import('bar')...`) must appear after all static import statements. They must follow this strict order at the top of the file: 1. Side-effect imports \u2192 2. import() expressions \u2192 3. static imports \u2192 4. declaration-style dynamic imports \u2192 5. runtime code.",
        "Preserve original spacing and formatting outside import blocks. Do not remove blank lines or reformat code unrelated to imports.",

        "Sort external imports using the priority order defined under 'sort priority'. Modules listed earlier in the list must appear before others. Any modules not listed are sorted alphabetically after prioritized ones.",
        "Treat scoped external packages (e.g., '@azure/storage-blob') as external imports.",
        "Preserve all scoped imports (e.g., '@azure/*') and ensure they're grouped under external imports.",
        "Do not remove any import statements regardless of whether the symbols are used or not.",
        "Preserve multi-symbol external imports in one line unless line length exceeds 120 characters.",
        "Scoped packages are considered external unless they match alias or relative paths explicitly.",
        "Preserve all import statements even if they appear outside the typical top-of-file location.",
        "Preserve the exact original formatting and spacing of the file outside of import blocks. Only modify the import blocks when applying alignment rules. Do not add or remove blank lines or whitespace outside of imports."
